            <p>Many states, local governments, and nonprofits offer programs to make homeownership more affordable.

          <h3>Mortgage insurance: what you need to know</h3>

          <p><strong>Mortgage insurance helps you get a loan you wouldn’t otherwise be able to.</strong> If you can’t afford a 20 percent down payment, you will likely have to pay for mortgage insurance. You may choose to get a conventional loan with private mortgage insurance (PMI), or an FHA, VA, or USDA loan.</p>
          <p><strong>Mortgage insurance usually adds to your costs.</strong> Depending on the loan type, you will pay monthly mortgage insurance premiums, an upfront mortgage insurance fee, or both. </p>
          <p><strong>Mortgage insurance protects the lender if you fall behind on your payments. It does not protect you.</strong> Your credit score will suffer and you may face foreclosure if you don’t pay your mortgage on time.</p>
