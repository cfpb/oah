                <p>Get quotes from three or more lenders so you can see how they compare.  Rates often change from when you first talk to a lender and when you submit your mortgage application, so don’t make a final decision before comparing official <a id="ask-gfe" href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/askcfpb/146/what-is-a-good-faith-estimate-what-is-a-gfe.html" target="_blank">Good Faith Estimates</a>.</p>

                <p>Make sure you’re getting the <a href="../loan-options/" target="_blank">kind of loan</a> that makes the most sense for you. If more than one kind of loan might make sense, ask lenders to give you quotes for each kind so you can compare. Once you’ve chosen a kind of loan, compare prices by getting quotes for the same kind of loan.</p>

                <p>Getting quotes from multiple lenders puts you in a better bargaining position.  If you prefer one lender, but another lender offers you a better rate, show the first lender the lower quote and ask them if they can match it.</p>

                <p>Don’t take out a car loan, make large purchases on your credit cards, or apply for new credit cards in the months before you plan to buy a house.  Doing so can lower your credit score, and increase the interest rate lenders are likely to charge you on your mortgage.</p>

                <p>If you don’t plan to buy for at least six months, you may be able to improve your credit scores and get a better interest rate.  Pay your bills on time, every time.  If you have credit card debt, pay it down.  But don’t close unused cards unless they carry an annual fee.</p>

                <p>If your down payment is less than 20 percent, you’ll typically get a higher interest rate and have to pay for mortgage insurance.  Save enough for a 20 percent down payment and you’ll usually pay less. Even going from a five percent down payment to a 10 percent down payment can save you money.</p>
